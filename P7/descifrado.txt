Ignite the drive (drive) in your soul
It's calling you!
Are you brave enough to be a fool?
I'm soaring higher
The clouds took me away
No one can find me
I know who I am
I was just a little lost
I don't know where to go
I don't know how to keep up
I'm not sure what I want
But don't get me wrong
I know who I am
Ignite the drive (drive) within your soul
It's calling you (calling you)
Ignite the drive (drive) within your soul
To each their own
Buckle up!
Rub-a-dub-dub (rub, rub-a-dub)
Yeah, yeah
Too late, my baby
Oh, hallelujah!
Rub-a-dub-dub (rub, rub-a-dub)
Yeah, yeah
I'm off and running
Let's start picking up the little
Extras of life
Oh, hallelujah!
I stumble many times
I might get hurt
But I keep on running
Who'd walk out on the street
Bothered about
Bumps in the road?
I'm scared of the laughter but
I love to laugh myself
Hear the words I only like
So let's smile and laugh
Buckle up!
Rub-a-dub-dub (rub, rub-a-dub)
Yeah, yeah
Too late, my baby
Oh, hallelujah!
Rub-a-dub-dub (rub, rub-a-dub)
Yeah, yeah
I'm off and running
Let's start picking up the little
Extras of life
Oh, hallelujah!
I'm soaring higher
I made it on my own
I'm the center of attention
I know who I am
I'm still lost, but I'm on this path
I don't know where to go
I don't know how to keep up
But don't get me wrong
I'm having a great time
Ignite the drive (drive) within your soul
It's calling you
Ignite the drive (drive) within your soul
To each their own
I fell down a lot
I hurt a lot
I was laughed at a lot
But then I realized
I just need to
Weed it out
Buckle up!
Rub-a-dub-dub (rub, rub-a-dub)
Yeah, yeah
Too late, my baby
Oh, hallelujah!
Rub-a-dub-dub (rub, rub-a-dub)
Yeah, yeah
I'm off and running
Oh, hallelujah!
Rub-a-dub-dub (rub, rub-a-dub)
Yeah, yeah
Too late, my baby (too late, my baby!)
Rub-a-dub-dub (rub, rub-a-dub)
Yeah, yeah
I'm off and running (oh, hallelujah!)
Let's start picking up the little
Extras of life
Oh, hallelujah!
